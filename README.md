# My Work
Below is some of the projects and assignments i have worked on in my time studying Computer Science. I hope
to be able to populate it with more personal projects or even talk about work i have done for organisations 
in the future! I have Experience in coding with Java, Python, HTML & CSS as well as some knowlege in Javascript.

## Mood Meter
My Mood Meter project was an IoT assignment i made in Year 2, where i used IoT tools to react to a users input. 
the program would react dependig on the mood the person gave to the Blynk app, or the raspberry pi.

## Social Bin Bot
The Social Robot was a project i had also done in Year 2 of my Computer Science course. This was made using a Microbit
controller along with sensors and a vision system to create a robot that interacts with the user.

## Warehouse Managment System
The Warehouse assignment was a project i had to do in Year 2. It was done using the knowlege we had learned in our
Data Structures & Algorithms module. It focuses on Generic Lists and the CRUD aspects behind them, along with some
minor HTML and CSS.
